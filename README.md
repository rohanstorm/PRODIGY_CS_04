# PRODIGY_CS_04
About This Python project logs every keystroke made by the user and stores the data in a local file for monitoring purposes. Built as part of my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, this project highlights how keyloggers operate and how important it is to protect against such attacks in real-world cybersecurity.
